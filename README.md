**What is this project?**

This program is a small game using Python and utilizing the pygame library.

**Why is this project useful?**

It has helped me with studying python as well as learning a bit about video game design.

**Who wrote this program?**

Myself. It was at first based on the game program from the "Complete Ethical Hacking Course" on Udemy. I then edited the code a whole bunch and basically created a whole new game.

**What this Github contains**

It contains the source code, the executable, and all the supporting files.

**Is it completed?**

No, I'm still working on it. The basic game is done though, but I still need to iron out some things.

**What do I for future implementations?**

Finish the graphics so that the first section of the game is finished.
For the future, perhaps I'll fully finish the whole game.
